								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								
								<p>I am a passionate full-stack and software developer with ample work experience entering the world of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo.</p>
								<p>I have completed various projects in the past, as big as a data visualization project that served over 2,000 clients under Capital Air Ltd., and as small as a 3D printed AI cat feeder.</p>
								<p>I speak English, Mandarin, and French fluently, and I have a multicultural background, being raised in two countries in my childhood. I am also fluent with most developer tools, most major languages, many modules, and many frameworks.</p>
								<p>I also love to play chess, enjoy various video games, write, or read a nice book.</p>
								<p>For professional contact, please reach me at my university email: <a href="mailto:r38su@uwaterloo.ca">r38su@uwaterloo.ca</a>, or my personal email: <a href="mailto:suruiquan10@163.com">suruiquan10@163.com</a>.</p>

									<h4>QuickSilver</h4>
									<div class="project-details">
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="Concept of the UI" /></span>
										<ul>
											<li>Built a broadcaster that sends the IP address, name, OS, MAC, and broadcast time in JSON format to every machine in the LAN, and a receiver that listens for all broadcasts on the LAN and organizes the information received based on OS types before returning it to the user.</li>
											<li>Built a file sending and receiving system via a TCP connection that allows the user to freely choose the target device (any broadcasting device in the LAN) and target file on the sender end, and a system to validate the file on the receiver end.</li>
											<li>Developed an alternative system via Bluetooth to accommodate situations without internet connection that sends and receives files via an RFCOMM port, and retains the same functionalities as the TCP system.</li>
											<li>Developed several mechanisms to prevent users from misusing the product, including simple malware detection, encryption, etc.</li>
											<li>Designed & built an UI with Tkinter that allows more user-friendly interactions.</li>
											<li>Ensured the scalability of the project by maintaining its compatibility and minimizing its dependencies, while also ensuring its decentralized nature, such as that with the broadcaster.</li>

											<li>Developed a solver algorithm that automatically seeks safe squares to be clicked on by listing the status of the grids in a matrix, then analyzing it with NumPy, and finally makes guesses when no square is obviously safe.</li>
											<li>Automated the solver with PyAutoGUI to automatically click on the most desirable grids.</li>
											<li>Built a failsafe algorithm to output advanced logging and takes screenshots when failure occurs to simplify the debugging process.</li>

									<h4>Soil Moisture Sensor</h4>
									<div class="project-details">
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="Concept of the Module"/></span>
										<ul>
											<li>Completed a thorough engineering design process, including drafting a proposal, assessing need, writing a design document, completing revisions, and performing an implementation demo of the soil humidity sensor module.</li>
											<li>Constructed a soil humidity module with 2 STM32 microcontrollers that inform the user whether a certain soil humidity is too low.</li>
											<li>Implemented communication using the UART protocol between the STM 32 to transmit the soil humidity data.</li>
											<li>Configured pins of the microcontrollers such that without using timer and PWM modules, a buzzer and 2 LEDs could be turned on and off according to the data received.</li>
											<li>Configured the analogue-to-digital converter in the STM 32 to convert the voltage detected by the capacitance soil moisture sensor to a percentage data, which is compared against a user-set threshold.</li>
											<li>Implemented, manually, in the sender module, a parity check by adding a parity bit at the end of the message, via the bit manipulation available in C++, without using the embedded parity function by STM.</li>
											<li>Implemented another function to decode the message and check for data corruption by checking for even parity in the receiver module.</li>
											<li>Without using IOC (STM32CubeMX) files in the STM32CubeIDE to generate code, manually initialized the microcontroller, UART peripherals, and configured pins by manually purely C coding, only possible through a robust understanding of microcontrollers.</li>
											<li>Understood the underlying concepts between powering and unpowering pins on microcontrollers, as well as how signal sending and receiving works between embedded electrical components and microcontrollers.</li>
